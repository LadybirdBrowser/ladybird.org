          Ladybird is a brand-new browser &amp; web engine. Driven by a web
          standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with
          good performance, stability and security.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5 max-w-96">
          From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby
          operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a
          cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like
          systems.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5 max-w-96">
          Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first
          Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.
