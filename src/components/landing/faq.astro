          <p>
            We are growing the team at a reasonable pace, as budget allows.
            Building the right team is more important than building it quickly.

        <summary>What does "No code from other browsers" really mean?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser engine
            from the ground up. We don't use code from Blink, WebKit, Gecko, or
            any other browser engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            For historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries from the
            SerenityOS project, which has a strong culture of writing <em
              >everything</em
            > from scratch. Now that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no
            longer bound by this culture, and we will be making use of 3rd party
            libraries for common functionality (e.g image/audio/video formats, encryption,
            graphics, etc.)
          </p>
          <p>
            We are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries that other
            browsers use, but we will never adopt another browser engine instead
            of building our own.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will Ladybird work on Windows?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We don't have anyone actively working on Windows support, and there
            are considerable changes required to make it work well outside a
            Unix-like environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would like to do Windows eventually, but it's not a priority at
            the moment.
          </p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Will Ladybird work on mobile devices?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We don't have anyone actively working on an Android or iOS port.
            More effort will be put into mobile once we have the desktop
            versions in a good state.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there is the start of an Android port in the project
            repository, mobile is not a priority at the moment.

        <summary>How can you be "independent" if you have sponsors?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            All sponsorships are in the form of unrestricted donations. Board
            seats and other forms of influence are not for sale.

          >Why build a new browser in C++ when safer and more modern languages
          are available?</summary
        >
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Ladybird started as a C++ project, and we now have almost half a
            million lines of modern C++ to maintain. We are currently evaluating
            options for a successor language and will share more when we're
            ready.
