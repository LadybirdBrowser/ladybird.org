question: What does "No code from other browsers" really mean
order: 3
---

The focus of the Ladybird project is to build a new browser engine from the
ground up. We don't use code from Blink, WebKit, Gecko, or any other browser
engine.

<br />

For historical reasons, the browser uses various libraries from the SerenityOS
project, which has a strong culture of writing _everything_ from scratch. Now
that Ladybird has forked from SerenityOS, it is no longer bound by this culture,
and we will be making use of 3rd party libraries for common functionality (e.g
image/audio/video formats, encryption, graphics, etc.)

<br />
We are already using some of the same 3rd party libraries that other browsers
use, but we will never adopt another browser engine instead of building our own.
