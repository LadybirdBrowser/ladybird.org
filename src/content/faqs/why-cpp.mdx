question: Why build a new browser in C++ when safer and more modern languages are available
---

Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only
allows C++. The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but
more one of personal convenience. Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when
creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half a million lines of modern C++
to maintain.

<br />
However, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project,
all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect. We are
actively evaluating a number of alternatives and will be adding a mature
successor language to the project in the near future. This process is already
quite far along, and prototypes exist in multiple languages.
