Hello\!

### `console.table()`

New contributor Gasim Gasimzada has been making improvements to our `console` API this month.
In particular, we were missing `console.table()`, which produces a table from the data passed in and prints it to the browser console.
At the time of writing, the [spec](https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#table) does not have an algorithm for this function,
so Gasim has [written one](https://github.com/whatwg/console/pull/237) and then implemented it in Ladybird.
Hopefully this algorithm will soon be made an official part of the spec, and help all browsers to behave consistently.

### CSS style values

Each CSS property's value is stored as one or more "style value" classes.
We have many of these, and until recently, they were very freeform and unrelated to any specs.
This month, we started moving these in line with the [CSS Typed OM spec](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1),
which defines a way for JavaScript to access styling as objects, instead of just strings.
So far, the main change is that we now store colors in whatever form they were written,
instead of converting them to a 32-bit RGBA value during parsing.
This means that using `calc()` inside a color function (such as `background-color: hsl(calc(15deg * 8) 50% 80%)`)
now finally works, which has been a problem for a long time!

### Retained display list

LibWeb's rendering process is divided into two stages.
The first stage involves building a list of draw commands (display list), and the second is the actual rasterization of the commands visible in the viewport from this list.
Until this month, the display list was built from scratch for each frame repaint.
The time required for building the display list depends on the size of the paintable tree, which caused slow repainting of pages with a lot of content, even though we could rasterize them relatively quickly.

This month, we took the first step towards improving this by reusing the display list across repaints if the only thing that requires invalidation is a scroll offset.
This is implemented by separating the display list into two parts:

- The list of draw commands, where each has an associated "scroll frame id"
- The list of scroll frames, where each frame has an id and scroll offset.

Before repainting, the display list is combined with the scroll offsets from the scroll frames list to produce the final draw commands, ready for rasterization.
