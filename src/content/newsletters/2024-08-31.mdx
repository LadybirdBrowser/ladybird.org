Hello\!

### `console.table()`

New contributor Gasim Gasimzada has been making improvements to our `console` API this month.
In particular, we were missing `console.table()`, which produces a table from the data passed in and prints it to the browser console.
At the time of writing, the [spec](https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#table) does not have an algorithm for this function,
so Gasim has [written one](https://github.com/whatwg/console/pull/237) and then implemented it in Ladybird.
Hopefully this algorithm will soon be made an official part of the spec, and help all browsers to behave consistently.

### CSS style values

Each CSS property's value is stored as one or more "style value" classes.
We have many of these, and until recently, they were very freeform and unrelated to any specs.
This month, we started moving these in line with the [CSS Typed OM spec](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1),
which defines a way for JavaScript to access styling as objects, instead of just strings.
So far, the main change is that we now store colors in whatever form they were written,
instead of converting them to a 32-bit RGBA value during parsing.
This means that using `calc()` inside a color function (such as `background-color: hsl(calc(15deg * 8) 50% 80%)`)
now finally works, which has been a problem for a long time!
