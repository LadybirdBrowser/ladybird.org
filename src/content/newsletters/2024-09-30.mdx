Please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org) if you are interested in sponsoring the project.

### CSS Transitions

This month, Ladybird gained support for the `transition` property, which allows authors to automatically animate changes to CSS properties. A lot of websites use this for subtle effects and it really makes the browser feel more polished. Many thanks to Matthew Olsson who contributed the bulk of this over the past several months.

### CSS Cascade Layers

It's fairly common for websites to have multiple sets of styles, for example a reset style sheet, a general framework, and then bespoke styling for particular elements. This can run into issues with "specificity", where styles get applied in the wrong order because of the selectors used.

The `@layer` rule give authors the ability to group sets of styles into layers which apply in a particular order, so that one layer always overrides the previous one. This can really help to keep CSS organized and reduce surprises.

We've now implemented `@layer`, which makes a big difference on websites that use it. Even though it's a relatively new feature, it was a focus of the [Interop 2022](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022) effort and so is expected for all browsers to support it.

### Style Sheet Inspector

As part of an effort to make CSS issues easier to debug, we now have a basic style sheet inspector built into the browser dev tools, which lets you view the contents of any style sheets that apply to the current page.

### Networking with curl

This month we've replaced our home-grown HTTPS stack with the [curl](https://curl.se/) library. It's been a huge boost for both performance and correctness, as we are now able to load many more websites and they all load significantly faster!

### SVG and CSS masks on the GPU

We now offload alpha and luminance mask rendering to the GPU if possible. This is implemented by using Skia's [SkSL shader language](https://skia.org/docs/user/sksl/) and yields a substantial speedup on websites making heavy use of masks.

### Emoji support

Before the fork, emoji support was implemented using custom bitmap images hand-drawn by SerenityOS contributors.
However, it was temporarily broken when we switched to using Skia for rasterization.
This month, emoji support has been restored, now implemented by rendering emoji glyphs extracted from a font: Apple Color Emoji on macOS and Noto Color Emoji on other platforms.
Moreover, this support is more complete than before, as now we handle ZWJ sequences by utilizing grapheme-aware text segmentation, thanks to Tim Flynn.

### Web Platform Tests

This month has seen great progress on the Web Platform Tests\!

We now have a dashboard to track progress of WPT scores over time. This can be viewed [here](https://grafana.app.ladybird.org/public-dashboards/2365098a185541cf8c7273830a789493?orgId=1).

At the time of writing we are passing 588,982 more subtests than last month bringing the total to 1,510,615\!

Our current WPT progress can be seen [at wpt.fyi](https://wpt.fyi/results/?product=ladybird).

### Audio support

We have been replacing our home-grown audio codecs with FFmpeg's excellent libavformat and
libavcodec, which means that we now support a wide range of audio formats out there on the web!
Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Opus, Wave and many more can now be heard in Ladybird.

### Font decoding using Skia

It's already been a couple of months since we switched to using Skia for text rasterization, but it was still piggybacking on our OpenType implementation, which resulted in a need to keep multiple decoded representations in memory for the same typefaces.
That's no longer the case, and we use Skia (which under the hood uses FontConfig on Linux and Core Text on macOS) to handle everything, including decoding, extracting all required metrics, and rasterization.
