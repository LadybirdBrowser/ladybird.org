### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) with $5,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### First-ever pizza ordered with Ladybird

A new kind of first this month: [the first-ever pizza ordered with Ladybird arrived safely and was reportedly delicious!](https://x.com/awesomekling/status/1846607417343463524)

Congratulations to X user [@Blasenblaeser](https://x.com/Blasenblaeser) for this exciting success!

### Expanding our Board of Directors

We've added two new board members:

- [Tim Flynn](https://ladybird.org/posts/tim-flynn-joins-board/): one of our long-term independent contributors. Ladybird leans on the OSS community, and we want to ensure our project remains open and pleasant for independent contributors!

- [Mike Shaver](https://ladybird.org/posts/mike-shaver-joins-board/): a browser industry veteran, former VP of Engineering at Mozilla, Director of Engineering at Facebook, and many other things. Mike is a hardcore engineering leader and will help us raise the bar for Ladybird and ourselves.

### Fixing excessive repainting by locking refresh rate

Until recently, we used a "push" model for repainting. Any event that might invalidate rendering, like scrolling a page, would schedule event loop processing to perform style, layout, or painting updates if necessary. Repainting in this fashion often resulted in excessive work, as we produced more frames than the display could render.

This month, we solved this issue by switching to a "pull" model, where the repainting task is always scheduled 60 times per second and performs style, layout, and paint updates if necessary. Making this change also aligned us more closely with the model described in the HTML specification.

### CSS filter support

Although Ladybird already implemented a number of CSS backdrop filters, it now has support for the CSS `filter` property
with which you can modify the graphical appearance of elements.

We support blurring, drop shadows, grayscale, sepia, and many more.

### Nested styling

This month we implemented basic support for CSS nesting, allowing style rules to be nested within each other.
This can help with organising large CSS files by grouping related styling together.
For example, we now support this:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;

  &:hover {
    color: magenta;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  > img {
    border: 1px dotted currentcolor;
  }
}

/*
 * ...which is equivalent to:
 */

a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:hover {
  color: magenta;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a > img {
  border: 1px dotted currentcolor;
}
```

Work is still ongoing to allow nesting other rules, such as `@media` queries.

### More colors

CSS has an increasingly-large variety of ways of declaring colors, and this month Lucas Chollet implemented the
`lab()`, `lch()`, and `color()` functions. `color()` in particular lets authors use specify what color space to use.

### Progress on input events and contenteditable support

With the following changes being made, it's now possible to chat on Discord using Ladybird:

- Added basic support for dispatching `input` and `beforeinput` events. This is required by Slate.js, which is used on Discord and intercepts all input events, managing the contenteditable state on the JS side.
- Made a large refactoring to combine the internal representation of caret position and selection into a single object. It solved a bug where Slate.js wants to update the caret position using the Selection API, which didn't work because we were not synchronizing the state of selection with the object that controls the input position.

### WebAudio improvements

WebAudio allows you to set up complex audio processing graphs using a comprehensive API. This month, we've seen a number
of small improvements in supporting these APIs such as `BaseAudioContext.decodeAudioData()`, which among others, allows
you to pass the loading screen of [ZType](https://zty.pe/) and actually play the game!

### Improvements to our testing infrastructure

This month we've begun importing tests from WPT into our own internal test suite. This means we're getting some parts of WPT coverage in our CI system as well.

More tests means more time waiting for CI, so we've also made two big changes to improve performance:

- Our internal test suite now runs in parallel across multiple processes.
- We've switched our CI builds from Debug+Sanitizers to ReleaseWithDebugInfo+Sanitizers.

### Clip-path shapes

For a long time we've supported `clip-path: polygon(...)`, but there are a lot of other ways of declaring the clip-path.
This month, Gingeh implemented the `inset()`, `xywh()`, `rect()`, `circle()`, and `ellipse()` functions, along with
fill-rule support. This makes websites that use clip-paths look much nicer.

In the screenshot below, each black element is clipped, revealing the gray of its parent.
