### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) with $5,000
- [Jonathan Lahijani](http://jonathanlahijani.com) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Expanding our Board of Directors

We've added two new board members:

- [Tim Flynn](https://ladybird.org/posts/tim-flynn-joins-board/): a long-time independent contributor. Ladybird leans on the OSS community, and Tim's presence ensures we stay an inviting place for open-source contributors!

- [Mike Shaver](https://ladybird.org/posts/mike-shaver-joins-board/): an industry veteran, former VP of Engineering at Mozilla, and former Director of Engineering at Facebook. Mike brings engineering leadership and deep experience that will help us push Ladybird to new heights.

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

October saw strong progress on WPT compliance.

We're now passing **54,590** more subtests than last month, reaching **1,565,597** total!

Particular effort has been made this month in improving our WebDriver implementation. We now implement all of the
endpoints required by the WebDriver specification. This allows us to run many more tests, which use WebDriver to
simulate various kinds of user interaction.

### Improvements to our testing infrastructure

To increase CI coverage, we've begun importing parts of WPT directly into our own test suite.

More tests means more time waiting for CI, so we've also made two changes to improve performance there:

- Our internal test suite now runs in parallel across multiple processes.
- We've switched our CI builds from Debug+Sanitizers to ReleaseWithDebugInfo+Sanitizers.

### Smarter repainting with a locked refresh rate

We've overhauled our approach to repainting. Previously, any rendering-related event, like scrolling, would trigger style, layout, and/or paint updates, often creating excess frames that weren't even displayed.

The new approach is a "pull" model, syncing repaints to a 60fps schedule, and aligning us more closely with the rendering model in the HTML specification. This drastically reduces redundant work and improves performance.

### Progress on input events and contenteditable

Big strides were made on input events, especially around `input` and `beforeinput` events.

We also reworked how we manage caret positions and selection to sync seamlessly with JavaScript-managed contenteditable states like those in Slate.js.

Ladybird can now handle chat on platforms like Discord thanks to these improvements!

### WebAudio improvements

WebAudio allows you to set up complex audio processing graphs using a comprehensive API. This month, we've seen a number
of small improvements in supporting these APIs such as `BaseAudioContext.decodeAudioData()`, which among other things allows
you to pass the loading screen of [ZType](https://zty.pe/) and actually play the game!

### CSS filter support

We've implemented the CSS `filter` property, with support for various visual effects like blur, drop shadows, grayscale, hue rotation, and many more!

### More colors

This month, Lucas Chollet added support for lab(), lch(), and color() functions in CSS. These provide more options for color declarations, with color() letting you specify the color space directly.

### Nested styling

Basic support for CSS nesting with the `&` selector is now in Ladybird! This allows style rules to be grouped, keeping large style sheets tidier:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;

  &:hover {
    color: magenta;
    text-decoration: none;
  }

  > img {
    border: 1px dotted green;
  }
}

/*
 * ...which is equivalent to:
 */

a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:hover {
  color: magenta;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a > img {
  border: 1px dotted green;
}
```

Support for nesting `@media` queries is coming up next.

### Clip-path shapes

Gingeh extended our `clip-path` capabilities to include the `inset()`, `xywh()`, `rect()`, `circle()`, and `ellipse()` functions, as well as `fill-rule` support. With these new options, websites that use clip-paths look much sharper in Ladybird.

In the screenshot below, each black element is clipped, revealing the gray of its parent.

### First-ever pizza ordered with Ladybird

A new kind of first this month: [the first-ever pizza ordered via Ladybird arrived safely and was reportedly delicious!](https://x.com/awesomekling/status/1846607417343463524)

Congratulations to X user [@Blasenblaeser](https://x.com/Blasenblaeser) on this one-of-a-kind accomplishment!
