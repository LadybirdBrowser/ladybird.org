### Expanding our Board of Directors

We've added two new board members:

- [Tim Flynn](https://ladybird.org/posts/tim-flynn-joins-board/): one of our long-term independent contributors. Ladybird leans on the OSS community, and we want to ensure our project remains open and pleasant for independent contributors!

- [Mike Shaver](https://ladybird.org/posts/mike-shaver-joins-board/): a browser industry veteran, former VP of Engineering at Mozilla, Director of Engineering at Facebook, and many other things. Mike is a hardcore engineering leader and will help us raise the bar for Ladybird and ourselves.

### Fixing excessing repainting by locking refresh rate

Until recently, we used a "push" model for repainting. Any event that might invalidate rendering, like scrolling a page, would schedule event loop processing to perform style, layout, or painting updates if necessary. Repainting in this fashion often resulted in excessive work, as we produced more frames than the display could render.

This month, we solved this issue by switching to a "pull" model, where the repainting task is always scheduled 60 times per second and performs style, layout, and paint updates if necessary. Making this change also aligned us more closely with the model described in the HTML specification.
