November is wrapping up, and it's been another productive month for the Ladybird project. We merged 454 PRs from 55 contributors, with improvements across multiple areas. Here's what we've been working on:

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [37signals](https://www.37signals.com) with $10,000
- [Paul Copplestone](https://paul.copplest.one) with $10,000
- [Puter](https://www.puter.com) with $1,000
- [Follower24.de](https://follower24.de) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued actively improving our WPT score in November, totaling 63,699 more passing subtests than last month, bringing our total to 1,629,296.

For context, here's our one-month progress on WPT alongside 3 major engines and 2 fellow underdogs.

And since 60% of the WPT score is legacy CJK text encoding tests, let's also look at the score with those tests omitted:

### Temporal rewrite

[Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) is a modern date/time API proposal for ECMAScript. We implemented it a couple of years ago, but the spec has since changed significantly.

Rather than trying to retrofit our old implementation, we opted for a complete rewrite this month. The result is a clean, up-to-date implementation that brings our overall [ECMAScript conformance](https://test262.fyi/#) to 97%, the highest of any engine.

### Swift language adoption

We've announced that we're looking at Swift 6 as a possible C++ successor language for the project. This work has largely been exploratory so far, but we're excited about the benefits Swift could bring!

Initial work into the build system integration has led to some promising prototypes using the C++ interop features of Swift. We're still investigating how to best introduce Swift code into the codebase without causing
a mad dash to rewrite everything in Swift.

For more details on how we're approaching this, check out this post we made on the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/ladybird-browser-and-swift-garbage-collection/76084).

### Individual CSS transform properties

Support for the `scale`, `rotate`, and `translate` CSS properties is now available. These properties provide a simpler way to apply individual transforms without using the `transform` shorthand.

### CSS nesting improvements

Our CSS nesting implementation is now complete, with support for nesting inside `@media`, `@supports`, and `@layer` rules.

Example:

```css
.thing {
  font-size: 20px;

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }

  @media (min-width: 800px) {
    font-size: 30px;

    img {
      max-width: 25%;
    }
  }
}
```

This produces the same result as writing out fully qualified selectors manually.

### Vertical text

Initial support for vertical text layout with the `writing-mode` property is now available. This improves layout and rendering for pages like MDN's browser compatibility tables.

### Web Crypto API

The Web Crypto API has been expanded to include support for HMAC and ECDH, along with improvements to existing algorithms. These additions make it easier for web applications to perform cryptographic operations like hashing, signing, and encryption.

### DNS over TLS

We've added support for DNS-over-TLS (DoT), which encrypts DNS queries to improve privacy and security.

### GPU-accelerated `<canvas>`

The Skia GPU backend now powers `<canvas>` rendering in addition to page rendering, delivering significant performance improvements for 2D graphics. A major GPU texture caching issue was also fixed, reducing redundant uploads and improving frame rates.

### Ladybird at GitHub Universe

Last month, GitHub held its annual Universe conference in San Francisco, California. We were invited to participate in their Open Source Zone exhibition area, where 5 projects
each day of the conference had a booth to showcase their project.

We had a great time talking to attendees about Ladybird and showing off some of the cool features we've been working on.
The highlights of the conference were the time we had to chat with GitHub's Open Source Developer Relations team, and the opportunity to meet some of the other projects in the Open Source Zone.

### `mask-image` CSS property

With support for the `mask-image` property, Ladybird can now render complex visual effects like the “torch effect” on [null.com](https://null.com).

### Pointer events

Support for `pointerup`, `pointerdown`, and `pointermove` events has been added. Combined with other fixes, this makes interactive apps like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) functional in Ladybird.

### Content Security Policy

Initial support for [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) has been added. This lets Ladybird enforce site-defined restrictions to reduce vulnerabilities like XSS. Websites like GitHub and PayPal now enforce their CSPs in Ladybird.

### More CSS `color()` Support

The CSS `color()` function now supports additional color spaces, including `a98-rgb`, `display-p3`, `prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `srgb-linear`, and `xyz-d65`.

### Editing API

Work on the `document.execCommand()` API has started, beginning with basic commands like `delete`. This lays the groundwork for future rich-text editing support.
