November is wrapping up, and it’s been another productive month for the Ladybird project. We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, with improvements across multiple areas. Here’s what we’ve been working on:

### Welcoming new sponsors

This month, we welcomed several new sponsors:

- [37signals](https://www.37signals.com) with $10,000
- [Paul Copplestone](https://paul.copplest.one) with $10,000
- [Puter](https://www.puter.com) with $1,000
- [Follower24.de](http://follower24.de) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you’re interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued actively improving our WPT score in November, totaling 63,031 more passing subtests than last month, bringing our total to 1,628,628.

For context, here’s our one-month progress on WPT alongside 3 major engines and 2 fellow underdogs.

And since 60% of the WPT score is legacy CJK text encoding tests, let’s also look at the score with those tests omitted:

### Temporal rewrite

[Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) is a modern date/time API proposal for ECMAScript. We implemented it a couple of years ago, but the spec has since changed significantly.

Rather than trying to retrofit our old implementation, we opted for a complete rewrite this month. The result is a clean, up-to-date implementation that brings our overall [ECMAScript conformance](https://test262.fyi/#) to 97%, the highest of any engine.

### Individual CSS transform properties

Support for the `scale`, `rotate`, and `translate` CSS properties is now available. These properties provide a simpler way to apply individual transforms without using the `transform` shorthand.

### CSS nesting improvements

Our CSS nesting implementation is now complete, with support for nesting inside `@media`, `@supports`, and `@layer` rules.

Example:

```css
.thing {
  font-size: 20px;

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }

  @media (min-width: 800px) {
    font-size: 30px;

    img {
      max-width: 25%;
    }
  }
}
```

This produces the same result as writing out fully qualified selectors manually.

### Vertical text

Initial support for vertical text layout with the `writing-mode` property is now available. This improves layout and rendering for pages like MDN’s browser compatibility tables.

### Web Crypto API

The Web Crypto API has been expanded to include support for HMAC and ECDH, along with improvements to existing algorithms. These additions make it easier for web applications to perform cryptographic operations like hashing, signing, and encryption.

### DNS over TLS

We’ve added support for DNS-over-TLS (DoT), which encrypts DNS queries to improve privacy and security.

### GPU-accelerated `<canvas>`

The Skia GPU backend now powers `<canvas>` rendering in addition to page rendering, delivering significant performance improvements for 2D graphics. A major GPU texture caching issue was also fixed, reducing redundant uploads and improving frame rates.

### `mask-image` CSS property

With support for the `mask-image` property, Ladybird can now render complex visual effects like the “torch effect” on [null.com](https://null.com).

### Pointer events

Support for `pointerup`, `pointerdown`, and `pointermove` events has been added. Combined with other fixes, this makes interactive apps like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) functional in Ladybird.

### Content Security Policy

Initial support for [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) has been added. This lets Ladybird enforce site-defined restrictions to reduce vulnerabilities like XSS. Websites like GitHub and PayPal now enforce their CSPs in Ladybird.

### More CSS `color()` Support

The CSS `color()` function now supports additional color spaces, including `a98-rgb`, `display-p3`, `prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `srgb-linear`, and `xyz-d65`.

### Editing API

Work on the `document.execCommand()` API has started, beginning with basic commands like `delete`. This lays the groundwork for future rich-text editing support.

### Credits

We’d like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
