### Temporal do-over begins

FIXME

### Individual CSS transform properties

We now support the `scale`, `rotate` and `translate` CSS properties, which offer a simplified way to assign specific transforms without using the generic `transform` property.

### CSS nesting

We now support `@media` rules inside a CSS nesting context.

FIXME: Add example.

### Vertical text

We have some initial support for vertical text layout and rendering with the `writing-mode` property.

FIXME: Add example.

### Web Crypto API

We've added support for many new algorithms.

FIXME: Specifics.

### DNS over TLS

FIXME

### GPU-accelerated `<canvas>` and texture caching

The Skia GPU backend now powers not only page rendering but also CanvasRenderingContext2D rendering, delivering better performance.
Additionally, a major GPU painting performance issue has been addressed, removing the necessity to re-upload textures to the GPU for each frame.

### `mask-image` CSS property support

With support of this property we can now accurately render the relatively complex "torch effect" on https://null.com/, which is composed of `mask-image`, `background-clip`, and a radial gradient.

### Pointer events support

We implemnted dispatching for pointerup, pointerdown and pointermove events.
Combined with couple of other fixes, it's now possible to paint on https://excalidraw.com/
