November 2024 is coming to an end, and we've had another solid month in the Ladybird project. We've merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, making strides across many areas.

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [37signals](https://www.37signals.com) with $10,000
- [Paul Copplestone](https://paul.copplest.one) with $10,000
- [Puter](https://www.puter.com) with $1,000
- [Follower24.de](http://follower24.de) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Temporal do-over

[Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) is a proposal to bring a modern and featureful date/time API to the ECMAScript language.
We implemented this proposal a couple of years ago, but in the time since, the proposal has been refactored substantially, and we had not kept up.
We decided it would not have been feasible to make our existing implementation fit the rewritten proposal, so we re-implemented it from scratch
this month.

In doing so, our overall [ECMAScript conformance](https://test262.fyi/#) has risen to 97%, which is the highest of any engine!

### Individual CSS transform properties

We now support the `scale`, `rotate` and `translate` CSS properties, which offer a simplified way to assign specific transforms without using the generic `transform` property.

### CSS nesting

We now support `@media` rules inside a CSS nesting context.

FIXME: Add example.

### Vertical text

We have some initial support for vertical text layout and rendering with the `writing-mode` property.

FIXME: Add example.

### Web Crypto API

We've added support for many new algorithms.

FIXME: Specifics.

### DNS over TLS

FIXME
