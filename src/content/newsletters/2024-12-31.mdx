December is wrapping up, and it's been another productive month for the Ladybird project. We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, here are some highlights:

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com) with $16,384
- [SimonBitwise](https://nomis.dk) with $1,200

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

In addition to these new sponsors, Ladybird has been chosen as one of ten beneficiaries of the [2024 Proton Lifetime Fundraiser](https://proton.me/blog/2024-lifetime-account-charity-fundraiser)!

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

This month, number go up!

### Replacing home-grown crypto with OpenSSL

We've begun adopting OpenSSL as a mature replacement for our home-grown LibCrypto (inherited from SerenityOS).

This gives us battle-hardened correctness as well as a boost in performance.

So far, only the hashing functions have been ported, and there's more work to do.

### Canvas2D filters

We now support the `filter` property on `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.

FIXME: Visual example.

### RegExp.escape proposal implemented

We've implemented the [RegExp.escape stage 3 proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-regex-escaping/) for JavaScript.

### CSS `calc()` improvements

We now support `calc()` inside `@media` queries, for example:

```css
@media (width >= calc(30em + 60px)) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Behind the scenes, we have been busy modernizing how `calc()` and other math functions work. The specification has
changed a lot since we first implemented it, for example, allowing `calc()` to multiply and divide different types
together, as long as the end result is the correct type. We now support this much better internally.

### Switch input

We implemented the experimental "switch" form control. These are commonly used in native iOS and Android apps, so it is
good to see them becoming part of the web platform too. For example, this HTML:

```html
<input type="checkbox" switch /> Off
<br />
<input type="checkbox" switch checked /> On
```

Now looks like this by default:

### Font variants

We now implement the CSS `font-variant` shorthand property, and its longhands `font-variant-alternates`,
`font-variant-caps`, `font-variant-east-asian`, `font-variant-emoji`, `font-variant-ligatures`, `font-variant-numeric`,
and `font-variant-positional`. These are used to configure options on fonts, giving authors more control over their
typography.

### WebGL

There was some initial groundwork to implement [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) with the
homegrown LibGL from the SerenityOS project in June 2022. This only saw the implementation of the "clear" draw operation, as
LibGL did not support shaders. This month, we've started implementing WebGL with the [ANGLE library](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGLE_(software)>),
allowing major progress to be made!
