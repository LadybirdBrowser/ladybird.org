December is wrapping up, and it's been another productive month for the Ladybird project. We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, here are some highlights:

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- Someone with some money

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

This month, number go up!

### CSS `calc()` improvements

We now support `calc()` inside `@media` queries, for example:

```css
@media (width >= calc(30em + 60px)) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Behind the scenes, we have been busy modernizing how `calc()` and other math functions work. The specification has
changed a lot since we first implemented it, for example, allowing `calc()` to multiply and divide different types
together, as long as the end result is the correct type. We now support this much better internally.

### Switch input

We implemented the experimental "switch" form control. These are commonly used in native iOS and Android apps, so it is
good to see them becoming part of the web platform too. For example, this HTML:

```html
<input type="checkbox" switch /> Off
<br />
<input type="checkbox" switch checked /> On
```

Now looks like this by default:

### Font variants

We now implement the CSS `font-variant` shorthand property, and its longhands `font-variant-alternates`,
`font-variant-caps`, `font-variant-east-asian`, `font-variant-emoji`, `font-variant-ligatures`, `font-variant-numeric`,
and `font-variant-positional`. These are used to configure options on fonts, giving authors more control over their
typography.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
