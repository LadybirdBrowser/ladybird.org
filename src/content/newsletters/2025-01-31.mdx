January has come to an end! We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, let's take a look at some of the highlights!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- Pending approval

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued to make progress on improving our WPT compliance in January with 24,898 more passing subtests than last month, bringing our total to 1,763,289.
In particular, significant progress has been made in our Web Crypto API coverage, where we now have a subtest pass rate of over 99%, which is higher than any other major browser!

### CSS `contain` property

Ladybird now understands the `contain` property, which lets authors restrict an element's effect on the rest of the page, for example preventing them affecting other elements' layout.
This opens the way for a variety of future optimizations.

### CSS `isolation` property

We now support `isolation: isolate`, which prevents an element from visually blending with what is behind it, even if it would usually do so.

### CSS `user-select` property

This property lets authors control which elements on the page are selectable, and how that selection works.
For example, always selecting the entire element, or not allowing a click-and-drag selection to extend outside where it started.

### Color-scheme

Our support for light and dark mode improved this month.
Web pages can now declare whether they prefer light or dark mode, or both, using `<meta name="color-scheme">`, and they can control this for each element using the `color-scheme` CSS property.
Additionally in CSS, we now support the `light-dark()` function, which lets an element pick a color based on whether it is in light or dark mode.

## `calc()` simplification

Calculations in CSS such as `calc()`, `min()`, or `sin()` are required to be simplified as much as possible.
This month we made some progress towards that, by simplifying calculations just after parsing them.
While doing so, we found and reported a couple of issues with the spec algorithm.
We see it as part of our role to find these issues, as the clearer and more correct the specs can be, the easier it is for all browsers to implement them, and behave consistently.

## WebCrypto API improvements

We added a number of missing algorithms to our WebCrypto implementation this month. We now have support for Ed448 and RSA-PSS, as well as the P-521 elliptic curve.
We've also continued to migrate our existing, home-grown implementation to use OpenSSL, which has significantly improved both correctness and performance.

## Optimized `:hover` style invalidation

The amount of work required to update style after the hovered element changes is drastically reduced by recalculating style only for elements that match a different set of :hover selectors, instead of recalculating the entire subtree.

## Optimized style invalidation triggered by attribute changes

We've started implementing [invalidating sets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vEW86DaeVs4uQzNFI5R-_xS9TcS1Cs_EUsHRSgCHGu8/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.xa3ovcncd2vp). This optimization technique allows to narrow number of invalidated elements by using metadata collected from CSS rules.

### Google BotGuard support

When signing into Google, an anti-bot script is ran in the background. This failed to run to completion in Ladybird, resulting in the "This browser or app is not secure" error message.
After tracking the issue to a missing deoptimization required by eval, BotGuard now runs to completion, allowing us to sign into Google!
