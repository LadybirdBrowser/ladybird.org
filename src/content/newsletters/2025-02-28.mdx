It's been another productive month for the Ladybird project! We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, let's take a look at some of the highlights!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- FIXME: Mention Shopify renewal
- FIXME: Mention Proton foundation

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued making significant improvements in WPT compliance: **??** more passing subtests than last month! This brings our total to **??**.

### DevTools

This month, we've begun integrating Ladybird with Firefox's DevTools application! DevTools is not only vital to web development,
but is crucial for browser developers to investigate websites that aren't yet displaying correctly. Ladybird already had its own
home-grown tools for inspecting a web page, but by moving towards Firefox's tried-and-true DevTools protocol, we will be able
to diagnose problems much more easily.

We've only just begun this integration, but we can already inspect a website's layout and style, and interact with the page
from the DevTools console!
