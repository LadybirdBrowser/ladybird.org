It's been another productive month for the Ladybird project! We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, let's take a look at some of the highlights!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- FIXME: Mention Shopify renewal
- FIXME: Mention Proton foundation

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued making significant improvements in WPT compliance: **??** more passing subtests than last month! This brings our total to **??**.

### DevTools

This month, we've begun integrating Ladybird with Firefox's DevTools application! DevTools is not only vital to web development,
but is crucial for browser developers to investigate websites that aren't yet displaying correctly. Ladybird already had its own
home-grown tools for inspecting a web page, but by moving towards Firefox's tried-and-true DevTools protocol, we will be able
to diagnose problems much more easily.

We've only just begun this integration, but we can already inspect a website's layout and style, and interact with the page
from the DevTools console!

### Filtering the inspector

Our own dev-tools also got an upgrade, with the ability to filter the property lists, making it easier to find what you are looking for.
We also fixed a long-standing bug that made the browser crash if you tried to inspect a `::marker` pseudo-element.

### Image cursors

We now support custom images in the `cursor` property, so you can browse like it's the 90s again!

### Better CSS serialization

We continued our work to serialize CSS more correctly. When JavaScript asks for the style of an element, it gets the value as a string, and it's important that it's a consistent format from browser to browser: the same values in the same order. This also impacts our WPT
score, as many tests check these style strings to see if a property is supported. If we support it, but produce a wrong string, the
test fails. This month we worked on serializing font properties and math functions closer to spec.

### New pseudo-classes

We gained a few new pseudo-classes this month: `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:user-valid`, and `:user-invalid` all apply to input elements
that have valid or invalid values. They are commonly used to highlight form elements that need correcting.

`:open` now also matches any input elements that have a picker currently open. Currently that means `<input type=color>` and
`<input type=file>`.

### Text decorations for errors

We added support for `text-decoration: spelling-error` and `text-decoration: grammar-error`, which mimic the underlines you see in typical word processors.

### TextEncoderStream

We've implemented the [streaming version of TextEncoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoderStream), which converts the input to UTF-8 bytes.
This is used by the server-side rendering mode of React Router, which is used by ChatGPT:

### Waiting to render until we have the CSS

We now delay the initial rendering of pages until we've loaded all the CSS referenced by `<link>` elements. This is an important part of preventing [FOUC (flash of unstyled content)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content).

Pictured below are three stages of loading our GitHub repo in Ladybird while CSS is downloading. Until now, we would render the first two stages, but with these new changes, we wait until we have enough to give you the third one directly.

## Constraint validation API

This month we have started to implement the Constraint Validation API. This prevents a form from being submitted if it contains invalid data.

Currently, we have implemented the `required` attribute, which checks that the element has a value, and the `pattern` attribute, which checks that the element's value matches the given regular expression.

## The `inert` attribute

We now support the `inert` attribute, which can be added to any element to make it non-interactive, non-focusable and non-findable. This is useful for modals, popups, and other content that should not be interacted with.

## Style invalidation optimizations

We've made several incremental optimizations to reduce unnecessary style recalculations, but the most significant change is that presence of styles using `:has()` no longer trigger a full-page recalculation. Instead, only the relevant ancestor elements are updated, making the process much more efficient in the worst case.

### OpenSSL adoption continues

The work on moving off of our own home-grown cryptography library and onto the battle-tested OpenSSL goes on. This month we've ported the following features to OpenSSL and removed our own implementations:

- TLS 1.2
- HKDF
- PBKDF2
- Curve25519
- Ed25519
- Ed448
- X25519
- X448

### libcurl adoption continues

Last fall we moved the bulk of our networking stack to libcurl, but left a few stragglers behind that were still using our own home-grown
socket abstractions and TLS code. This month we moved our WebSocket implementation to use libcurl. There are still features that
libcurl's WebSocket implementation doesn't support, such as per-message compression and WebSockets over HTTP/2. The new libcurl
backend for our WebSocket implementation means that we are using libcurl for almost all networking the the browser and
associated helper programs.

### aarch64 Linux continuous integration

We have been using GitHub Actions for pull request testing for a long time, but we only had x86_64 Linux and aarch64 macOS runners. This month we took
advantage of GitHub's [new public aarch64 Linux runners](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-16-linux-arm64-hosted-runners-now-available-for-free-in-public-repositories-public-preview/)
to add a nightly aarch64 Linux job. Adding the job required fixing some rough edges in aarch64 Linux support.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
