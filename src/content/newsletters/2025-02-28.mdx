It's been another productive month for the Ladybird project! We merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors, let's take a look at some of the highlights!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- FIXME: Mention Shopify renewal
- FIXME: Mention Proton foundation

We are incredibly grateful for their support! If you're interested in sponsoring, [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued making significant improvements in WPT compliance: **??** more passing subtests than last month! This brings our total to **??**.

### DevTools

This month, we've begun integrating Ladybird with Firefox's DevTools application! DevTools is not only vital to web development,
but is crucial for browser developers to investigate websites that aren't yet displaying correctly. Ladybird already had its own
home-grown tools for inspecting a web page, but by moving towards Firefox's tried-and-true DevTools protocol, we will be able
to diagnose problems much more easily.

We've only just begun this integration, but we can already inspect a website's layout and style, and interact with the page
from the DevTools console!

### Filtering the inspector

Our own dev-tools also got an upgrade, with the ability to filter the property lists, making it easier to find what you are looking for.
We also fixed a long-standing bug that made the browser crash if you tried to inspect a `::marker` pseudo-element.

### Image cursors

We now support custom images in the `cursor` property, so you can browse like it's the 90s again!

### Better CSS serialization

We continued our work to serialize CSS more correctly. When JavaScript asks for the style of an element, it gets the value as a string, and it's important that it's a consistent format from browser to browser: the same values in the same order. This also impacts our WPT
score, as many tests check these style strings to see if a property is supported. If we support it, but produce a wrong string, the
test fails. This month we worked on serializing font properties and math functions closer to spec.

### New pseudo-classes

We gained a few new pseudo-classes this month: `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:user-valid`, and `:user-invalid` all apply to input elements
that have valid or invalid values. They are commonly used to highlight form elements that need correcting.

`:open` now also matches any input elements that have a picker currently open. Currently that means `<input type=color>` and
`<input type=file>`.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
