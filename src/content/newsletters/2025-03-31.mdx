Intro goes here!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Sponsors go here!

### New `@supports` features

We now support the `font-format()` and `font-tech()` functions inside `@supports` rules, which allow authors to choose
what CSS to apply based on our font support.

Also, we fixed a couple of bugs with `@supports selector()`, so that works more reliably.

Behind the scenes, `@media` and `@supports` now share the same code for parsing and evaluating a boolean expression.
This makes them easier to maintain, and prepares us for future CSS features such as `@when`.

### Pseudo-elements

This month, we started generating a lot of the pseudo-element code from a JSON file, similar to how we do for
pseudo-classes. This makes it simpler to add new ones, but also makes it easier to add a few new features such as
aliases, and limiting which properties can be applied to different pseudo-elements.

This has allowed us to replace our `::-webkit-*` pseudo-elements, which we implemented in the past for a few form
widgets, with ones based on the new CSS Forms spec, while still supporting sites that use the `-webkit-*` or `-moz-*`
versions.

We also have support for function pseudo-elements, for example `::foo(bar)`, which are being used more and more in
recent CSS features.

### `background-blend-mode`

We implemented the `background-blend-mode` property, which lets authors apply different blending modes to their
backgrounds, for a variety of visual effects.
