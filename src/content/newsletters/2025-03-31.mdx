March 2025 is all wrapped up, and it's been another solid month for the Ladybird project. We’ve merged 285 PRs from 47 contributors, and made progress on all fronts.

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is fully funded through the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [ohne-makler.net](https://www.ohne-makler.net) with $50,000
- [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) with $5,000
- [Travis Heinström](https://heinstrom.com) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Site Isolation

Site isolation is an important security feature in modern browsers, ensuring that two different websites never share the
same OS process. This helps ensure a malicious website cannot access your data from any other website. We have started
implementing this feature in Ladybird, and although it is not complete, it is a crucial step towards protecting users.

### New `@supports` features

We now support the `font-format()` and `font-tech()` functions inside `@supports` rules, which allow authors to choose
what CSS to apply based on our font support.

Also, we fixed a couple of bugs with `@supports selector()`, so that works more reliably.

Behind the scenes, `@media` and `@supports` now share the same code for parsing and evaluating a boolean expression.
This makes them easier to maintain, and prepares us for future CSS features such as `@when`.

### Pseudo-elements

This month, we started generating a lot of the pseudo-element code from a JSON file, similar to how we do for
pseudo-classes. This makes it simpler to add new ones, but also makes it easier to add a few new features such as
aliases, and limiting which properties can be applied to different pseudo-elements.

This has allowed us to replace our `::-webkit-*` pseudo-elements, which we implemented in the past for a few form
widgets, with ones based on the new CSS Forms spec, while still supporting sites that use the `-webkit-*` or `-moz-*`
versions.

We also have support for function pseudo-elements, for example `::foo(bar)`, which are being used more and more in
recent CSS features.

### `background-blend-mode`

We implemented the `background-blend-mode` property, which lets authors apply different blending modes to their
backgrounds, for a variety of visual effects.

### Settings Page

We've begun implementing a unified settings page for Ladybird, available now at `about:settings`. This will allow us to
centralize all Ladybird settings in a single interface, providing a common experience across all platforms.

### Firefox DevTools

Last month, we started implementing the Firefox DevTools protocol, making it possible to use Firefox's developer tools
with Ladybird. This month, we've implemented the ability to inspect style sheets and fonts, and expanded our integration
with the JavaScript console. We have also added support for performing live-edits of web elements directly from DevTools.

We have implemented enough of the protocol that we were able to remove our home-grown tooling, and now rely entirely on
DevTools!

### Debugging our dinner

Last week, we've been dogfooding Ladybird on UberEats.com - using it as our primary way to order food while actively
hunting down bugs. A lot of little quirks and major blocking issues were fixed to the point where we were successfully
able to find a restaurant, order the food, pay for it and even track the order to our doorstep!

### Add intrinsic sizes cache for faster relayout

Intrinsic size refers to the dimensions a box would naturally take based on its content when constrained by available
space, for example, the maximum height of a box when the available width is 100px. Layout algorithms compute many such
intrinsic sizes during the process of determining a box's final size, requiring additional layout passes with varying
constraints. Caching these intrinsic measurements for boxes unaffected by layout invalidation is a good step towards
improving layout performance and reducing redundant computations during relayout.

### FFmpeg Demuxing

In June 2024, we switched to decoding videos with FFmpeg, which gave us access to decoding non-VP9 videos. However, we
did not demux video containers with FFmpeg and still used our homegrown Matroska demuxer. For example, this meant we
could only play H.264 videos if they were in an MKV container file. This month, we've replaced our Matroska demuxer
with FFmpeg's libavformat demuxer. This provides us access to all the container files FFmpeg supports, the most popular
one being MP4.

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-mar-2025-video-chrome-for-devs-view-transitions-demo.mp4"></source>
</video>

If we don't advertise support for (Managed)MediaSource, we can even play the 360p H.264 fallback videos YouTube provides!

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-mar-2025-video-rickroll.mp4"></source>
</video>

Try playing the above MP4 videos in Ladybird!

### Move rasterization into separate thread

Over a year ago, we introduced display lists that represent an immutable, serialized sequence of painting commands.
This month, we finally took advantage of that architecture by moving rasterization of display lists off the main thread.
As a result, the main thread now has more time to handle other tasks like garbage collection and script execution.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
