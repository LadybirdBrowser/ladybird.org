Intro goes here!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Sponsors go here!

### Site Isolation

Site isolation is an important security feature in modern browsers, ensuring that two different websites never share the
same OS process. This helps ensure a malicious website cannot access your data from any other website. We have started
implementing this feature in Ladybird, and although it is not complete, it is a crucial step towards protecting users.

### New `@supports` features

We now support the `font-format()` and `font-tech()` functions inside `@supports` rules, which allow authors to choose
what CSS to apply based on our font support.

Also, we fixed a couple of bugs with `@supports selector()`, so that works more reliably.

Behind the scenes, `@media` and `@supports` now share the same code for parsing and evaluating a boolean expression.
This makes them easier to maintain, and prepares us for future CSS features such as `@when`.

### Pseudo-elements

This month, we started generating a lot of the pseudo-element code from a JSON file, similar to how we do for
pseudo-classes. This makes it simpler to add new ones, but also makes it easier to add a few new features such as
aliases, and limiting which properties can be applied to different pseudo-elements.

This has allowed us to replace our `::-webkit-*` pseudo-elements, which we implemented in the past for a few form
widgets, with ones based on the new CSS Forms spec, while still supporting sites that use the `-webkit-*` or `-moz-*`
versions.

We also have support for function pseudo-elements, for example `::foo(bar)`, which are being used more and more in
recent CSS features.

### `background-blend-mode`

We implemented the `background-blend-mode` property, which lets authors apply different blending modes to their
backgrounds, for a variety of visual effects.

### Settings Page

We've begun implementing a unified settings page for Ladybird, available now at `about:settings`. This will allow us to
centralize all Ladybird settings in a single interface, providing a common experience across all platforms.

### Firefox DevTools

Last month, we started implementing the Firefox DevTools protocol, making it possible to use Firefox's developer tools
with Ladybird. This month, we've implemented the ability to inspect style sheets and fonts, and expanded our integration
with the JavaScript console. We have also added support for performing live-edits of web elements directly from DevTools.

We have implemented enough of the protocol that we were able to remove our home-grown tooling, and now rely entirely on
DevTools!

### Debugging our dinner

Last week, we've been dogfooding Ladybird on UberEats.com - using it as our primary way to order food while actively
hunting down bugs. A lot of little quirks and major blocking issues were fixed to the point where we were successfully
able to find a restaurant, order the food, pay for it and even track the order to our doorstep!
