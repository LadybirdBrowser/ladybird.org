April is done! It's been a pleasantly productive month for the Ladybird project. We’ve merged 288 PRs from 36 contributors and made strong progress on multiple fronts.

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

As usual, we've been making solid progress on WPT. This month, we've squeezed out a new **17,214** passing tests for a total of **1,799,262**.

For context, here are the top 6 engines at the end of March vs end of April:

### Performance work

Performance is one of our weak points, but this month we've invested some time in improving it!

We've focused particularly on the [Speedometer 2](https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.1) and [Speedometer 3](https://browserbench.org/Speedometer3.1) benchmarks, which are designed to test browser responsiveness and performance when using popular frameworks.

We've improved our Speedometer 2 score by 47%, and our Speedometer 3 score by 38%. (But we have a long way to go before matching the performance of major browser engines.)

### Faster JavaScript function calls

We've made a number of changes to how function calls work in our JavaScript engine, all with the goal of reducing the amount of work that happens before we begin executing a called function.

In the past, stack frames had separate storage for local variables, temporary registers, constants, and function arguments. This has gone from multiple heap allocations to a single stack allocation.

We've also made it the caller's responsibility to set up the callee stack frame. This allows the caller to put callee arguments directly in the right memory location.

Our bytecode ISA also gained a new operand type: _argument_. This allows instructions to reference arguments directly, instead of first having to copy them from the stack frame.

### Flexbox layout optimization

When analyzing layout performance on Speedometer, we found an interesting optimization opportunity.

For flex items that have `auto` minimum size in the main axis (so `min-width:auto` in row layouts and `min-height:auto` in column layouts), we're supposed to calculate an ["automatic minimum size"](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox-1/#min-size-auto). Usually, this size calculation requires determining the intrinsic size of the flex item. This can be very expensive, as it requires an entirely separate layout pass over the flex container and its descendants.

We realized that the automatic minimum size is not actually required in cases where the flex line is large enough to accommodate all flex items at their normal "base" sizes. This turns out to be extremely common on the web, so we now do a lot less flex layout work on tons of websites!

### Script-blocking style sheets

Per the HTML spec, some style sheets are supposed to prevent JavaScript from executing until the CSS is fully downloaded.
In the past, we'd just run scripts without waiting. This could lead to elements having unexpected metrics, etc. since they were being observed without style applied.

Now that we implement script-blocking style sheets, we don't perform intermediate layout work with incorrect style information, meaning less overall work (faster!), and no glitches from missing style information (better!)

### RegExp engine optimizations

Regular expressions are widely used for string manipulation. This month we introduced a number of significant optimizations, both large and small, that improve RegExp performance by up to 16x.

Since linear input scanning is the default and most common mode, it's crucial to reject invalid positions as quickly as possible. We've added an optimization that skips entering the RegExp virtual machine when the first comparison or assertion would immediately fail. This allows for fast seeking in patterns like `/x(...)/`.

We've also improved the heuristic for converting alternations into decision trees. For example, a pattern like `/ab|ac|d/` is now more efficiently represented, reducing unnecessary backtracking and yielding up to a 4x performance boost on its own.

### Google Maps 3D View

Our WebGL support keeps improving, and now it's even possible to use the 3D View in Google Maps (although it's very unstable and requires `User-Agent` spoofing).

### JavaScript benchmarking

At the end of March, we started tracking our JavaScript performance by running a range of JavaScript benchmark suites for
every change in the Ladybird repository. Originally we only tracked these for the Linux x86-64 platform, but since this
month we also have a dedicated Mac Mini M4, chugging along to provide us with additional macOS ARM64 results which can
be seen on [the public dashboard](https://linegodown.lol).

### Dialog backdrops

Our support for the `<dialog>` element got better this month, as we now generate `::backdrop` pseudo-elements.
These are commonly used to blur or fade out the rest of the page when a modal dialog is open.

Seen below is our settings page using `::backdrop` to make the other settings less distracting while configuring languages.

### Scrollbars

In modern browsers, scrollbars are actually painted as part of the web content by the rendering engine itself. This is
how browsers handle multiple scrollable areas on the web page at once, as well as the various CSS `overflow` properties.

We've enhanced our scrollbar interactions this month to slightly widen the scrollbar when it is hovered. This makes it easier to click-and-drag the scrollbar. We've also added a gutter to the scrollbars to allow users to click anywhere within the gutter to scroll to that position.

### CSS descriptor parsing

Descriptors are the CSS term for properties in `@font-face` and other at-rules, which control behavior other than setting an
element's style. For a long time these have been hard-coded for `@font-face` only, but this month we replaced that with
a more flexible system similar to how we process style properties. This means we can now expose them to JavaScript
through `CSSFontFaceRule.style`, and should also make it easier to add new at-rules and descriptors in the future.

### CSS URLs

CSS uses URLs for loading images and fonts, and `@import`-ing other style sheets, among other uses. In the past, we
would always complete any relative URLs (`like/this/one.png`) during parsing. However, we're supposed to wait until the URL is used before doing so, with a few spec algorithms telling us exactly when to do so. The most visible
place this matters is that several JavaScript APIs expect to get the original URL text, but there are other subtle
bugs that can happen if the page rearranges the style sheets after the CSS has been parsed.

This month we started correcting this, so far for `@import` and image loading, with the other places to follow soon.

### Streams

[Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) are how data retrieved from the network is
processed. There is a comprehensive API to interact with streams available to web developers. Streams are also used
extensively by the browser itself to internally handle downloaded resources.

We've refined our implementation of the Streams API this month to better align ourselves with the spec. In particular,
our [stream piping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeTo) operations have been greatly
improved. This ensures that we handle fetched resources more correctly, and makes the browser more resilient to various
errors.

### Floating & clearing elements

Thanks to rigorous testing and bug reporting from the community, we've improved the outcome of many situations where
`float: ..` or `clear: ..` were used to create or avoid floating elements. Ladybird now handles most websites with these
correctly, but make sure to let us know if you find one where it does not!

### IndexedDB Progress

Many websites use IndexedDB to store data locally. This month we made a number of improvements to our implementation that have increased our WPT score in the IndexedDB category by more than 2x.
We now pass close to 1/3 of the tests for IndexedDB. While our implementation still has a long way to go, the scaffolding continues to improve.

We currently store IndexedDB data in memory in each renderer process, but we plan to move to a more robust storage solution in the future once the Web APIs are fleshed out.

### URLPattern

This month we implemented [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern), a web platform primitive for declarative
URL matching using pattern syntax. The syntax is based off the popular [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp)
library.

`URLPattern` is already in use by several emerging web specifications, including the
[Service Worker Static Routing API](https://github.com/WICG/service-worker-static-routing-api), the
[Use-As-Dictionary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Use-As-Dictionary) HTTP header, and
the [Speculation Rules API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

### State-preserving atomic move integration

We have added support for the `moveBefore()` DOM API. This allows for reparenting or reordering DOM nodes without the side
effects of running the [removing steps](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-remove-ext) and
[insertion steps](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert-ext).

Unlike `insertBefore()`, which implicitly removes and re-inserts the node, `moveBefore()` performs an atomic move.
The resulting state preservation is useful in many cases, including:

- `<iframe>` elements (prevents reloads or browsing context destruction).
- Active selections or focused form controls.
- Open/close state of popovers.
- Preserving active state of animations.
