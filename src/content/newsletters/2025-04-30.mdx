We did some things in April!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web.

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

TESTS GO BRRRR

### Dialog backdrops

Our support for the `<dialog>` element got better this month, as we now generate `::backdrop` pseudo-elements.
These are commonly used to blur or fade out the rest of the page when a modal dialog is open.

Seen below is our settings page using `::backdrop` to make the other settings less distracting while configuring languages.

### Descriptor parsing

Descriptors are the CSS term for properties in `@font-face` and other at-rules, which so something other than set an
element's style. For a long time these have been hard-coded for `@font-face` only, but this month we replaced that with
a more flexible system similar to how we process style properties. This means we can now expose them to JavaScript
through `CSSFontFaceRule.style`, and also should make it easier to add new at-rules and descriptors in the future.

### CSS URLs

CSS uses URLs for loading images and fonts, and `@import`-ing other style sheets, among other uses. In the past, we
would always complete any relative URLs (`like/this/one.png`) during parsing, However, we are supposed to instead wait
until the URL is used before doing so, with a few spec algorithms telling us exactly when to do so. The most visible
place this matters is that several JavaScript APIs expect to get the original URL text, but there are other subtle
bugs that can happen if the page rearranges the style sheets after the CSS has been parsed.

This month we started correcting this, so far for `@import` and image loading, with the other places to follow soon.

### Streams

[Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) are how data retrieved from the network is
processed. There is a comprehensive API to interact with streams available to web developers. Streams are also used
extensively by the browser itself to internally handle downloaded resources.

We've refined our implementation of the Streams API this month to better align ourselves with the spec. In particular,
our [stream piping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeTo) operations have been greatly
improved. This ensures that we handle fetched resources more correctly, and makes the browser more resilient to various
errors.
