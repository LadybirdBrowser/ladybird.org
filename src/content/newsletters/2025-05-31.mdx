May is done! It's been a pleasantly productive month for the Ladybird project. We’ve merged ?? PRs from ?? contributors and made strong progress on multiple fronts.

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [The Primeagen](https://terminal.shop/) with $5,000

- [b1ack0wl](http://www.b1ack0wl.com/) with $1,000
- [Clément Sibille](https://lisible.xyz/) with $1,000

- [Philip Lonsing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiplonsing/) with $1,000
- [Sjors Witteveen](https://kabutops.com/) with $1,000

We are incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

As usual, we've been making solid progress on WPT. This month, we've squeezed out a new **?** passing tests for a total of **?**.

For context, here are the top 6 engines at the end of April vs end of May:

### Clipboard APIs

There are a handful of [clipboard APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API) available for
web developers to interact with the user's clipboard. For example, code blocks on GitHub repositories have a handy
button to copy the code to the clipboard. We had previously implemented just one of these APIs, and this month we've
implemented the rest! These are `clipboard.read`, `clipboard.readText`, `clipboard.write`, and `clipboard.writeText`.
And not to worry! These APIs have security built into them to protect users from malicious actors.

### Transferable Streams

Last month, we refined our [streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) implementation to be
much better aligned with the spec. The last remaining feature that we hadn't implemented was
[stream transfer](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/blob/main/transferable-streams-explainer.md). This allows web
developers to transfer streams via `postMessage()` to, for example, a web worker. We've now implemented this feature,
and as a result, we now have a complete streams implementation!

### JavaScript engine optimizations

We've added new bytecode instruction that avoid creating temporary `{ done, value }` result objects when iterating over built-in types like Array, Map, Set and String. This means `for..of`, `for..in` and the spread operator now run with significantly less overhead.

We've applied a similar optimization to async functions, which internally rely on generators, and made them faster as well by avoid temporary objects allocation.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
