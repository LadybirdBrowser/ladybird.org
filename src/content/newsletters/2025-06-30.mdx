June is over, newsletter time. ðŸ—ž

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- SPONSOR with MONEY

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Some WPT things have probably occurred.

### Logical aliases

Some CSS properties are "logical aliases" for others, for example `margin-inline-start`. This means that the side or
direction they apply to depends on the text direction: for top-down text the "inline start side" is the top; for
left-to-right it's the left; and for right-to-left it's the right. Ladybird has long understood these properties, but
hard-coded them to left-to-right text. This month we replaced that with proper checks for the `writing-mode` and
`direction` properties. ([PR #5138](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5138))

### Counters on pseudo-elements

CSS counters let authors create automatic numberings similar to those in HTML numbered lists. This month we improved our
counters support by making the counter properties also work when applied to pseudo-elements.
([PR #5132](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5132))

For example, this is used by [terminal.shop](https://www.terminal.shop/) to display line numbers:

#### After

### `tech()` in `@font-face` sources

We implemented the `tech()` function in the `@font-face` `src` descriptor. Similar to `format()`, this lets authors
declare that the linked font file uses a particular font feature, and that browsers should ignore it if they do not
support that. This saves time and bandwidth by avoiding downloading files that we cannot make use of, such as variable
fonts or those using incremental transfer. ([PR #4983](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/4983))

### Local Storage Persistence

[Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is now persisted to disk within a sqlite database. Previously, data stored in local storage would be lost
when the WebContent process exited, making it work similarly to [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage). This is particularly useful for websites
that store access tokens in local storage, such as Discord.

### Geolocation

The Geolocation API allows websites to request and monitor the user's physical location, speed and heading. We have
added preliminary support for this API in Ladybird, only returning a single emulated position for now. In the future we
will hook this up to the system's location services together with the necessary permissions and privacy settings.

### Windows Progress

One of the most-asked questions we get is "When will Ladybird support Windows?" To be clear, the planned alpha and beta
releases will only be available for Linux and macOS. With that being said, community contributors are making steady
progress on the Windows port. This month, Windows support has progressed to the point that LibJS tests are passing on
Windows 10 and 11, albeit without ASAN and UBSAN enabled. We can also build the core of the browser engine, LibWeb,
though work remains to be done to be able to actually run the headless browser and WebContent processes.

### CI: macOS and Windows

In May, we've started using [Blacksmith's](https://blacksmith.sh/) action runners which already significantly reduces
the time it takes to run CI, providing us with quicker iterations on pull requests. In June, we started using our
self-hosted macOS runner removing one of the last performance bottlenecks that we had for PRs. Additionally, we now
support running CI for Windows on PRs which helps when reviewing them!

### Security Advisory update

We have received a few security reports via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature that we are in the process
of triaging. The first to be fixed was reported by [@intrigus](https://github.com/intrigus-lgtm), and was included in
a CTF at [GPN CTF 2025](https://gpn23.ctf.kitctf.de/). They have provided a writeup [here](https://github.com/s41nt0l3xus/CTF-writeups/tree/master/gpnctf-2025/WebGL-bird).

As we have yet to release an alpha or beta version of Ladybird, we are not yet publishing security advisories. However,
the experience with the currently reported vulnerabilities has shown that we have a lot of work to do to be
prepared to handle the types of security issues we expect from a full release. As we receive more reports and get closer
to a public release, we hope to share more details about our security process and how we plan to handle vulnerabilities
in accordance with our [Security Policy](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/b3d9e39bad4f4a394cf518f54af1937967fbea29/SECURITY.md).
