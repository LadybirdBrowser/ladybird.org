June is over, newsletter time. ðŸ—ž

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- SPONSOR with MONEY

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Some WPT things have probably occurred.

### Logical aliases

Some CSS properties are "logical aliases" for others, for example `margin-inline-start`. This means that the side or
direction they apply to depends on the text direction: for top-down text the "inline start side" is the top; for
left-to-right it's the left; and for right-to-left it's the right. Ladybird has long understood these properties, but
hard-coded them to left-to-right text. This month we replaced that with proper checks for the `writing-mode` and
`direction` properties. ([PR #5138](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5138))

### Counters on pseudo-elements

CSS counters let authors create automatic numberings similar to those in HTML numbered lists. This month we improved our
counters support by making the counter properties also work when applied to pseudo-elements.
([PR #5132](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5132))

For example, this is used by [terminal.shop](https://www.terminal.shop/) to display line numbers:

#### After

### `tech()` in `@font-face` sources

We implemented the `tech()` function in the `@font-face` `src` descriptor. Similar to `format()`, this lets authors
declare that the linked font file uses a particular font feature, and that browsers should ignore it if they do not
support that. This saves time and bandwidth by avoiding downloading files that we cannot make use of, such as variable
fonts or those using incremental transfer. ([PR #4983](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/4983))

### Local Storage Persistence

[Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) is now persisted to disk within a sqlite database. Previously, data stored in local storage would be lost
when the WebContent process exited, making it work similarly to [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage). This is particularly useful for websites
that store access tokens in local storage, such as Discord.

### Geolocation

The Geolocation API allows websites to request and monitor the user's physical location, speed and heading. We have
added preliminary support for this API in Ladybird, only returning a single emulated position for now. In the future we
will hook this up to the system's location services together with the necessary permissions and privacy settings.
