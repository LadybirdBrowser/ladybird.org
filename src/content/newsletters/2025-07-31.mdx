Hello friends! July is done!

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

_insert WPT stats here_

### `:state(foo)` and `:unchecked` pseudo-classes

We gained a couple of new pseudo-classes this month:

- `:state(foo)` matches a custom element that has `foo` in its states set. This lets custom elements be styled
  differently depending on their state, just like a regular element can be `:empty` or `:checked`, for example.
- Speaking of which, we also added `:unchecked`. This matches elements that can be checked, but currently are not.

### Logical property groups

Continuing work that was started [https://ladybird.org/newsletter/2025-06-30/#css-logical-aliases](last month),
we now generate the code that maps logical properties to physical ones, decreasing the amount of boilerplate to add
a new logical property. Logical and physical properties form "groups", for example all the `margin` properties, and
we now account for these when serializing them, and when modifying them through JavaScript.

### Arbitrary substitution functions

This mouthful of a name refers to CSS functions like `var()` which get substituted with an arbitrary chunk of CSS.
Recent versions of the CSS specs formally define how these work, and this month we rewrote our implementations of
`var()` and `attr()` to match this new definition. Besides being easier to maintain, this prepares us to more easily
add other arbitrary substitution functions in the future, such as `if()` and `env()`.

### `<syntax>` parsing

Some modern CSS features allow authors to specify their own CSS syntax which is then used to parse something else.
We've implemented the `<syntax>` type which corresponds to this, and it can now be used in `attr()`, to specify how
to interpret the attribute. For example, `attr(data-color type(<color>))` would parse the `data-color` attribute as
if it was a CSS color value.

### `@property` progress

We've had a stub implementation of `@property` for a while, and this month we started making some progress on it.
We now make use of a registered custom property's initial value, and we also gained initial support for `CSS.registerProperty()`.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
