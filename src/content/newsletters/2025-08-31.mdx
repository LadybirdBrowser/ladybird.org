We just finished August and some things have happened.

### Welcoming new sponsors

...

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

...

### CSS `env()` function

The CSS `env()` function lets authors style the page based on "environment variables": properties of the user's device,
for example the safe area of the screen on a non-rectangular display, or the user's preferred text scale. This month we
implemented support for it. Most of these environment variables apply more to mobile devices, but we have the groundwork
for any future variables that might be added, as well as upcoming CSS features that allow author-defined variables.

### CSS Typed OM API

Since JavaScript was first able to interact with the style of page elements, the only way to do so has been using
strings - reading a width as `"120px"` or the color as `"rgb(240, 246, 252)"`. This works, and it's intuitive to set the
background-color to `"yellow"`, but it makes it very awkward to work with any values that are read. As CSS syntax gets
more complex with features like `calc()` and `var()`, scripts would have to parse these values themselves into something
meaningful. The Typed OM API, part of Houdini, provides an alternative where style properties have structured values
that are easier to manipulate. A width would instead be a `CSSUnitValue` whose `value` is `120` and its `unit` is `"px"`.
A color provides its different color channels as numbers. Calculations form a tree of functions, etc.

This month we began the long process of implementing this API. So far, a few different types of value are readable, but
we don't yet support setting values in this way, and many different JavaScript methods are unimplemented. But it's an
encouraging start to a very exciting web feature.

### CSS Pseudo-classes

We gained another new pseudo-class this month: `:heading`, also in its `:heading()` form. As `:heading`, it applies to
all of the `<h1>` ... `<h6>` elements, but the `:heading()` form lets authors specify which heading levels to target,
for example `:heading(1, 3, 5)`.

### CSS Clamping and Interpolation Improvements

The result of a CSS calculation, or an interpolated value (using animations, transitions, or any other method), is
required to be clamped and normalized to be valid where it appears. For example, `font-size` can't be negative, so
`font-size: calc(1000px * -1)` would result in `0` not `-1000px`. Infinite and NaN values should also get replaced by
finite numbers. We previously didn't apply these constraints, but this month we've started doing so more correctly.

### Gamepad API

We implemented the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API), which allows you to
connect a gamepad and use it in Ladybird.

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">

</video>

This was implemented with the [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org) Gamepad API, making this work cross-platform and with all
methods of connection out of the box, for example with Bluetooth.

### WebGL support on Linux

Linux now has WebGL parity with macOS. The tricky part was cross-API GPU memory sharing between ANGLE and Skia.
Erik Kurzinger [landed the DMA-BUF plumbing](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5864) that unlocks it.

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
