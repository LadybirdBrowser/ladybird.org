September has ended, and we wrapped up the month with XX merged PRs from XX contributors.

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) with $100,000
- [K15t](https://www.k15t.com) with $5,000
- [Unkey](https://www.unkey.com) with $5,000

We're incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Progress on [WPT](https://web-platform-tests.org) continues. This month we squeezed out XX new passes for a total of XX.

For context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs one month ago.

### Custom property handling

Ladybird has supported CSS custom properties (also known as "variables") for a long time now, but there are many little
nuances that we didn't get quite right, especially when examining them from JavaScript.
This month, we made the `!important` keyword work for them ([PR #6329](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6329)),
exposed them in `CSSStyleProperties` ([PR #5989](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5989)),
made sure they appear in the correct order ([PR #6226](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6226)),
and added them to the properties list in the dev tools ([PR #6311](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6311)).

### DevTools improvements

Speaking of dev tools, we also fixed some issues where layout information would not be displayed ([PR #6312](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6312)),
and where the style sheets list would not appear in some circumstances ([PR #6315](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6315)).

### CSS Typed OM API

Carrying on from last month, we now implement the various CSSStyleValue classes for transform functions, which is
finally enough for most of the WPT tests to run instead of crashing immediately. There's still a lot to do, but it's
been nice to finally see some results!
(PRs [#6162](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6162), [#6176](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6176), and [#6227](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6227).)

### View transitions

[View transitions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/) are a way of animating between page states
(for example, from a product list to the details for one product), or even between different pages.
This month, a lot of the underlying machinery for this has been implemented ([PR #5155](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5155)).
It's going to take a bit longer before it's usable, but it's a good start to an exciting new web feature.

### Trusted Types

Carrying on the initial work from last month, we now support the following features of Trusted Types:

- [TrustedTypePolicyFactory#emptyHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedTypePolicyFactory/emptyHTML): Provides a guaranteed empty TrustedHTML object.
- [TrustedTypePolicyFactory#emptyScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedTypePolicyFactory/emptyScript): Provides a guaranteed empty TrustedScript object.
- [required-trusted-types-for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for): Allows you to only allow Trusted Type objects to go into the stated injection sinks, which is currently only 'script'.
- HTMLScriptElement now accommodates Trusted Types

There is still ongoing work to accommodate Trusted Types in other areas, such as the DOM APIs.

(PRs [#5828](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5828), [#6057](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6057) and [#6058](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6058))

### Global Privacy Control

[Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) (GPC) is a feature to notify websites that they are not
permitted to sell or share information about your activity on that website. It aims to be a replacement for the
[Do Not Track](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/doNotTrack) (DNT) feature, which fell short
of its goals due to a lack of legal enforcement. GPC, on the other hand, has legislation in progress to actually require
websites to respect the feature.

This month, we've replaced our DNT implementation with GPC ([PR #6175](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6175)),
and it can be enabled on our settings page!

### Generating application menus

Ladybird currently has two UI frontends. On macOS, we use [AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit?language=objc)
for a native-appearing application; all other systems currently fall back to a [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6) UI.
We've made many strides over the years to de-duplicate large batches of code between the frontends, via our LibWebView
library. This library is UI-agnostic, and is responsible for managing the ability to render websites.

The largest remaining area of code duplication was around creating application & context menus. Each UI had to create
these menus and their invocation actions individually. This month, we've introduced the ability to define these menus
and actions in LibWebView, from which our UIs now generate their frontend menus ([PRs #6062](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6062),
[#6221](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6221)). This not only makes maintaining our UIs simpler, but
now developers can define a menu item in a single location and each UI will automatically pick it up.

### Improved selection handling

We had a lot of noticeable issues when trying to copy selected text - more often than not, a different part of the text
would get copied. Turns out, the way we dealt with whitespace collapsing caused the text offsets to be shifted. This
also caused our [Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) offsets to be wrong. We now take care to
better map the original text offsets to the text you can select on screen. (PR [#6169](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6169))

### ::slotted() pseudo-element support

The pseudo-element allows styling of elements that are passed into a shadow DOM slot from outside the shadow tree.

### Animation compositing

This month we added support for animation compositing via the [`animation-composition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-composition)
property (PR [#6233](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6233)) and the,[`KeyframeEffect.composite`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyframeEffect/composite)
API (PR [#6213](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6213)). These features allow the user to control how
animations are combined when more than one apply to the same property, allowing for more complex layering of
animations.

### Stable setTimeout() firing order

When many `setTimeout(..., 1)` calls arrive in quick succession, several timers can share the same deadline. Previously, those ties were resolved arbitrarily.
We now assign each timer a monotonically increasing sequence id and break ties by (deadline, sequence_id), guaranteeing that equal-deadline timers fire in the
order they were registered. (PR [#6260](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6260))
