September has ended, and we wrapped up the month with XX merged PRs from XX contributors.

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) with $100,000
- [K15t](https://www.k15t.com) with $5,000
- [Unkey](https://www.unkey.com) with $5,000

We're incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Progress on [WPT](https://web-platform-tests.org) continues. This month we squeezed out XX new passes for a total of XX.

For context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs one month ago.

### Custom property handling

Ladybird has supported CSS custom properties (also known as "variables") for a long time now, but there are many little
nuances that we didn't get quite right, especially when examining them from JavaScript.
This month, we made the `!important` keyword work for them ([PR #6329](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6329)),
exposed them in `CSSStyleProperties` ([PR #5989](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5989)),
made sure they appear in the correct order ([PR #6226](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6226)),
and added them to the properties list in the dev tools ([PR #6311](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6311)).

### DevTools improvements

Speaking of dev tools, we also fixed some issues where layout information would not be displayed ([PR #6312](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6312)),
and where the style sheets list would not appear in some circumstances ([PR #6315](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6315)).

### CSS Typed OM API

Carrying on from last month, we now implement the various CSSStyleValue classes for transform functions, which is
finally enough for most of the WPT tests to run instead of crashing immediately. There's still a lot to do, but it's
been nice to finally see some results!
(PRs [#6162](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6162), [#6176](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6176), and [#6227](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6227).)

### View transitions

[View transitions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/) are a way of animating between page states
(for example, from a product list to the details for one product), or even between different pages.
This month, a lot of the underlying machinery for this has been implemented ([PR #5155](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5155)).
It's going to take a bit longer before it's usable, but it's a good start to an exciting new web feature.

### Trusted Types

Carrying on the initial work from last month, we now support the following features of Trusted Types:

- [TrustedTypePolicyFactory#emptyHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedTypePolicyFactory/emptyHTML): Provides a guaranteed empty TrustedHTML object.
- [TrustedTypePolicyFactory#emptyScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TrustedTypePolicyFactory/emptyScript): Provides a guaranteed empty TrustedScript object.
- [required-trusted-types-for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for): Allows you to only allow Trusted Type objects to go into the stated injection sinks, which is currently only 'script'.
- HTMLScriptElement now accomodates Trusted Types

There is still ongoing work to accomodate Trusted Types in other areas, such as the DOM APIs.

(PRs [#5828](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5828), [#6057](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6057) and [#6058](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6058))
