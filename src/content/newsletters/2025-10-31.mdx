### HTTP Disk Cache

Last month, we enabled our in-memory HTTP cache. This cache lives in a single WebContent process, and does not persist
across browser restarts.

We've now begun work an a persistent disk cache! (PRs [#6435](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6435),
[#6487](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6487), [#6579](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6579),
and [#6645](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6645)). This provides a second layer of caching, which will
make visits to the same websites much faster.

### Audio/Video Synchronization, Multi-Track Support

Previously, our media playback implementation relied on separate, unrelated audio and video playback systems to play media files where both are present. This meant that it was possible for audio and video to desynchronize very easily, especially when their seeking behavior was inconsistent.

This month, that implementation has been replaced with a singular new system which controls both the audio and the video, ensuring that they remain perfectly in sync at all times. (PR [#6410](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6410))

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-av-playback.mp4"></source>
</video>

As part of this reimplementation, several aspects of playback have improved:

- Seeking is done asynchronously, and can therefore complete much faster. Scrubbing the timeline now previews the new playback position instantly, instead of waiting for the mouse button to be released.
- Media elements now support the [audioTracks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks) and [videoTracks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks) properties, which allows scripts to interact with multiple audio or video tracks in a file, toggling them at will. The playback system mixes any enabled audio tracks into one output.
- The [fastSeek()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/fastSeek) function now follows spec with regard to seeking forward when the target is later than the current position.

### `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()`

These are relatively new CSS functions that enable authors to style or animate elements differently depending on how
many siblings they have and where they appear in that list.
This month we implemented support for these. (PRs [#6426](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6426) and
[#6526](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6526))

### Accessibility DevTools

Since switching away from our own inspector to using Firefox's developer tools, we've been missing a few features we
previously had. This month we reimplemented inspection of the accessibility tree - a structure parallel to the usual
element tree that represents how tools like screen readers see the page. We don't yet support such tools, but being able
to examine what's going on inside Ladybird will make that easier. (PR [#6462](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6462))

### CSS Typed OM progress

Continuing from last month, we're still working on the CSS Typed OM API, which allows authors to get and set style
properties using objects instead of strings. Ladybird now supports setting style with most types of CSSStyleValue.
(PRs [#6370](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6370), [#6378](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6378), [#6440](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6440), and [#6466](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6466))
