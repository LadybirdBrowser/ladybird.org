October is in the bag, and we merged 217 PRs from 43 contributors. Let's look at some highlights!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [Axeptio](https://axept.io) with $10,000 ([their announcement](https://www.axept.io/blog/ladybird-open-web))
- [Gravwell](https://gravwell.io) with $5,000

We're incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

We've continued to make solid progress on [WPT](https://web-platform-tests.org) this month. There has been a significant
increase in passing subtests, with **111,431** new passing subtests bringing our total to **1,964,649**.

The majority of this increase comes from a large update to the test suite itself, with **100,751** subtests being added -
mainly due the Wasm core tests being updated to Wasm 3.0.

This bump has seen us pass over 90% of all WPT subtests for the first time! An important milestone, as this is one of
the criteria used by Apple to determine eligibility for [alternative browser engines on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/).

For context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs one month ago.

### HTTP disk cache

Last month, we enabled our in-memory HTTP cache. This cache lives in a single WebContent process, and does not persist
across browser restarts.

We've now begun work an a persistent disk cache! (PRs [#6435](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6435),
[#6487](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6487), [#6579](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6579),
and [#6645](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6645)). This provides a second layer of caching, which will
make visits to the same websites much faster.

### Audio/video synchronization, multi-track support

Previously, our media playback implementation relied on separate, unrelated audio and video playback systems to play media files where both are present. This meant that it was possible for audio and video to desynchronize very easily, especially when their seeking behavior was inconsistent.

This month, that implementation has been replaced with a singular new system which controls both the audio and the video, ensuring that they remain perfectly in sync at all times. (PR [#6410](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6410))

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-av-playback.mp4"></source>
</video>

As part of this reimplementation, several aspects of playback have improved:

- Seeking is done asynchronously, and can therefore complete much faster. Scrubbing the timeline now previews the new playback position instantly, instead of waiting for the mouse button to be released.
- Media elements now support the [audioTracks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks) and [videoTracks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks) properties, which allows scripts to interact with multiple audio or video tracks in a file, toggling them at will. The playback system mixes any enabled audio tracks into one output.
- The [fastSeek()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/fastSeek) function now follows spec with regard to seeking forward when the target is later than the current position.

### `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()`

These are relatively new CSS functions that enable authors to style or animate elements differently depending on how
many siblings they have and where they appear in that list.
This month we implemented support for these. (PRs [#6426](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6426) and
[#6526](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6526))

### Accessibility DevTools

![](/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-a11y-devtools.png)

Since switching away from our own inspector to using Firefox's developer tools, we've been missing a few features we
previously had. This month we reimplemented inspection of the accessibility tree - a structure parallel to the usual
element tree that represents how tools like screen readers see the page. We don't yet support such tools, but being able
to examine what's going on inside Ladybird will make that easier. (PR [#6462](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6462))

### CSS Typed OM progress

Continuing from last month, we're still working on the CSS Typed OM API, which allows authors to get and set style
properties using objects instead of strings. Ladybird now supports setting style with most types of CSSStyleValue.
(PRs [#6370](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6370), [#6378](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6378), [#6440](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6440), and [#6466](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6466))

### Improved WebGL2 buffer support

We've improved support for the WebGL2 `.readPixels()` method and implemented the `.getBufferSubData()` method, which
are used to transfer pixel data between arbitrary buffers by libraries such as [SparkJS](https://sparkjs.dev/). (PR
[#6637](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6637))

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-sparkjs.mp4"></source>
</video>

### Improved offscreen WebGL framebuffer support

An issue with offscreen framebuffers being cleared after frame presentation caused the demo on the [PixiJS homepage](https://pixijs.com) not to display the masked/warped image of stars/nebulae. This has been fixed, so the demo appears correctly now:

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pixijs-home.mp4"></source>
</video>

### WebGL progress on Google Maps

There were some targetted WebGL fixes for Google Maps Globe View this month, including:

- Respecting [UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/pixelStorei)
- Returning null for missing uniforms instead of -1
- Calculating the correct pitch for 16-bit textures

This made Globe View have much less visual issues, with the sky not rendering being the biggest remaining issue.

</video>

(PR [#6558](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6558))

### CSS and SVG gradients

This month we've improved support for both CSS repeating linear gradients and SVG gradients with coordinates expressed
in `objectBoundingBox` units. This results in many such gradients looking a lot crispier and frankly, more correct! (PRs
[6533](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6533),
[6592](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6592))

### CanvasPattern

We had preliminary support in place for CanvasPattern, a way to create an image pattern based on an arbitrary image
source such as a canvas, an `<img>` or even a video frame. We did not actually use this pattern in drawing commands
though, causing some significant graphical artifacts. We do now, which causes the background on
[slither.io](https://slither.io) to finally render correctly!
(PR [6548](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6548))

### Pinch-to-zoom support

Ladybird now supports pinch-to-zoom on macOS (AppKit UI). VisualViewport API exposes the zoom transform.

<video controls style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <source src="/assets/img/newsletter-oct-2025-pinch-to-zoom.mp4"></source>
</video>

### Trusted Types in the DOM

Carrying on from the past couple months, Trusted Types support has been added to several DOM APIs:

- HTMLIFrameElement: srcdoc
- Element: setAttribute, setAttributeNS, setHTMLUnsafe, innerHTML, outerHTML and insertAdjacentHTML
- Document: write, writeln and parseHTMLUnsafe
- ShadowRoot: setHTMLUnsafe and innerHTML
- DOMParser: parseFromString
- Range: createContextualFragment
- Worker, SharedWorker and ServiceWorker constructors

(PRs [#6057](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6057) and [#6424](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6424))

### Ability to launch on Windows

Whilst Windows support is not the focus for the alpha release in 2026, the community has continued to improve
our Windows support. This month, Ladybird is now able to launch and be used on Windows!

(PR [#5981](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/5981))

### Initial support for XPath evaluations

Initial support for XPathEvaluator, XPathExpression, XPathResult, XPathNSResolver and Document.evaluate was added this month.
It uses libxml2 under the hood to run XPath evaluations on an XML tree compatible with the library that is created from our parsed XML tree.
This is a short-term solution to bring initial support to these classes, because there are differences between the DOM and XML implementations of XPath
which are not possible to workaround with libxml2.

This allows the htmx library to work in Ladybird, which is used by their website:

(PR [#6342](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6342))
