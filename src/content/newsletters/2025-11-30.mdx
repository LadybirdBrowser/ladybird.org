In November some things happened!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [37signals](https://37signals.com) with $10,000 (renewed sponsorship!)

We're incredibly grateful for their support. If you're interested in sponsoring the project, please [contact us](mailto:contact@ladybird.org).

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

WPT CONTINUES

### Variable fonts

In the past, a font file could contain multiple versions of a typeface such as bold and italic, but those would all be baked-in in advance. However, newer "variable fonts" are becoming increasingly popular on the web. These are configurable based on a few axes such as the weight, width, or slant, and generate the desired font on the fly. This saves on downloads, but also makes it possible to animate properties of the font.

We've had small parts of this implemented in various places for a while, but this month the pieces finally started coming together, and we can render fonts with variable widths and weights, instead of them always looking thin. (PR [#6439](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6439))

### Perspective and perspective-origin

This month we implemented these two CSS properties. When an element has some kind of 3D transform on it, `perspective` determines how far the camera is from the subject. `perspective-origin` determines where the vanishing point is positioned. Together they give authors a lot more control over how 3D designs look. (PRs [#6776](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6776) and [#6805](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6805))

### Unbuffered Fetch

There was two methods that our Fetch implementation worked in: unbuffered and buffered.
For unbuffered responses, data would become available immediately in the response upon being received from the network.
For buffered responses, we buffered the data into a single buffer and then provided that in the response after the Fetch completed.

This month, we removed the buffered mode, allowing all Fetch users to operate on partial data immediately.
However, individual Fetch users can still choose to buffer data by itself.
There is ongoing work to convert those users to use partial data, including HTML parsing and media decoding.

This allows ChatGPT responses to incrementally appear instead of appearing after the full response is generated.

### Respecting UNPACK_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_WEBGL

This [WebGL pixel storage parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/pixelStorei) determines if a texture should be uploaded with (un)premultipled alpha.
Previously we always upload textures with premultipled alpha, which made content expecting unpremultipled alpha to be visually broken.

### SVG improvements

This month we introduced support for `<feComponentTransfer>`, which allows you to define how color channels are
transferred, and `<feMorphology>`, which makes it possible to erode or dilate the shapes in the input image. On top of
that, we improved our interpretation of `<text>` and `<tspan>` attributes so text shows up in the right place.

### Faster Base64 conversion

The author of [simdutf](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf) published a [blog post](https://lemire.me/blog/2025/11/29/how-fast-can-browsers-process-base64-data/) about Base64 performance in browsers, and we took this as an opportunity to go from terrible performance to decent.

With a handful of optimizations in our runtime, we were able to improve the benchmark score in the blog post by:

- 3.8x faster `fromBase64()`
- 38.4x faster `toBase64()`

At this point, the main bottleneck is `malloc()` and that's something we'll eventually have to address as well.

### CSS @import rules now block first render

We now wait until CSS @import rules have downloaded their referenced style sheets before rendering the page. This avoids an unpleasant FOUC (flash of unstyled content).

### SVG images on the GPU

Most of our rendering has been GPU accelerated for over a year already, but one thing remained: SVG content embedded in `<img>` tags!

This month we've finally refactored the rendering architecture for SVG embedded images, and they too now render with GPU acceleration. This is significantly faster.

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
