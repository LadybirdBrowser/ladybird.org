### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

WPT CONTINUES

### Variable fonts

In the past, a font file could contain multiple versions of a typeface such as bold and italic, but those would all be baked-in in advance. However, newer "variable fonts" are becoming increasingly popular on the web. These are configurable based on a few axes such as the weight, width, or slant, and generate the desired font on the fly. This saves on downloads, but also makes it possible to animate properties of the font.

We've had small parts of this implemented in various places for a while, but this month the pieces finally started coming together, and we can render fonts with variable widths and weights, instead of them always looking thin. (PR [#6439](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6439))

### Perspective and perspective-origin

This month we implemented these two CSS properties. When an element has some kind of 3D transform on it, `perspective` determines how far the camera is from the subject. `perspective-origin` determines where the vanishing point is positioned. Together they give authors a lot more control over how 3D designs look. (PRs [#6776](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6776) and [#6805](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6805))
