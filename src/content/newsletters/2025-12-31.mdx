December has come and gone, and we ended up merging 197 PRs from 37 contributors. Let's check out some of the work that got done!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [FUTO](https://www.futo.org/) with $250,000 (renewal!) ([announcement + interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCa92gA1ARc))
- "Open Source Santa" with $5,000 (funds provided by [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), selected by polling the YouTube audience of [ThePrimeagen &amp; teej_dv](https://www.terminal.shop)
- [styfle](https://styfle.dev) with $1,000

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Progress on [WPT](https://web-platform-tests.org) continues. This month we've added 4,833 new test passes, bringing our total to 1,977,371.

### CSS features

We added basic support for the `::part()` pseudo-element, which lets custom elements expose parts of their shadow DOM for external styling. For example, `widget::part(quantity)` targets elements inside `widget`'s shadow DOM that have `part="quantity"`. There's still work to be done (particularly the `exportparts` attribute), but this already improves sites like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org): (PRs [#7034](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7034) and [#7077](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7077))

We also implemented the CSS `random()` function, which lets authors use random values in CSS properties without resorting to JavaScript. (PR [#6707](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6707))

{/* Would be nice to include an example, but I got a crash trying to make one: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/7192 */}

For `@import` rules, we implemented the `layer()` clause for placing imported style sheets inside CSS layers, and fixed bugs that were causing `supports()` clauses to parse incorrectly. (PRs [#6986](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6986) and [#7021](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7021))

On a more minor note, we implemented the `:autofill` pseudo-class. Ladybird doesn't support automatically filling form data yet, so this selector never matches, but it does now parse correctly. (PR [#7177](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7177))

### Media playback improvements

Building on our move to unbuffered fetch, we can now play incompletely-buffered media files, waiting for data over the network as needed. (PRs [#7049](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7049), [#7081](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7081), [#7084](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7084) and [#7132](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7132))

</video>

We can now play files with unspecified durations, or where the actual media data exceeds the specified duration. As data is decoded, we extend the timeline based on each frame's end timestamp. (PR [#6945](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6945))

We also added proper audio conversion for tracks with differing sample rates or channel counts. Previously, enabling a stereo track would make mono tracks inaudible since we had no conversion. Now we convert everything to the output device's native format as we decode, allowing all tracks to mix correctly. This also made it easy to re-add WAV playback support. (PRs [#7095](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7095) and [#7149](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7149))

### JavaScript performance

We made several performance improvements this month:

- Shrunk the generated interpreter code size, which particularly benefits Apple Silicon CPUs. (PRs [#7080](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7080), [#7087](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7087))
- Fixed `arguments` objects deoptimizing property access in functions with no named parameters. (PR [#7094](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7094))
- Added inline caches for setting object properties from C++ code (we only had them for getting properties). (PR [#7111](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7111))
- Various regular expression performance improvements. (PRs [#7111](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7111), [#7125](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7125))
- Added a dedicated bytecode instruction for the `x|0` pattern used to coerce values to 32-bit integers. (PR [#7140](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7140))
- Made the `prototype` field on function objects lazily instantiated, since most code never uses it. (PR [#7167](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7167))
- Eliminated a redundant copy of all JavaScript source code. (PR [#7209](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7209))

### HTTP caching

We enabled HTTP disk cache by default ([#6991](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6991)), reducing redundant network traffic on repeat visits. We also implemented the `stale-while-revalidate` Cache-Control directive ([#7121](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7121)), which serves stale responses immediately while revalidating with the origin server in the background.

### Garbage collector leak fixes

We spent time hunting down GC leaks this month. At the start, a full `test-web` run ended with ~240 leaked Window objects. Through a series of fixes, we brought that down to ~25.

The main culprit was improper use of `GC::Root`, storing strong references in places where they kept objects alive forever. This happened in 2D canvas fill/stroke styles, the rejected promises list, custom elements reaction stack, BroadcastChannel, and IndexedDB. Most fixes involved switching to `GC::Weak` references. We also introduced `GC::HeapVector`, a vector container that properly participates in GC. (PRs [#7223](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7223), [#7230](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7230), [#7235](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7235), [#7246](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7246))

### Modern cryptography algorithms

There has been ongoing work to implement [modern cryptography algorithms](https://github.com/WICG/webcrypto-modern-algos) for the [Web Cryptography API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API), with initial support for:

- [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) (PR [#6942](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6942))
- [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) (PR [#6962](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6962))
- [decapsulateBits, decapsulateKey, encapsulateBits and encapsulateKey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_encapsulation_mechanism) (PRs [#6961](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6961) and [#7042](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7042))
- [ML-DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography#CRYSTALS-Dilithium) (PR [#6935](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6935))
- [ML-KEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyber) (PR [#6970](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6970))
