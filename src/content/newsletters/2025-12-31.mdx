### The `::part()` pseudo-element

In December we got basic support for the `::part()` pseudo-element, which lets custom elements expose parts of themselves for styling by the outside world. For example `widget::part(quantity)` will target any elements inside `widget`'s shadow-dom that have a `part="quantity"` attribute. (PRs [#7034](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7034) and [#7077](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7077))

There's still work to be done, in particular to support the `exportparts` attribute, but this already improves the appearance of some websites, for example the login button on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org):

### The `random()` CSS function

Another new addition this month is the CSS `random()` function. As its name suggests, this enables authors to use random values in CSS properties, without having to resort to JavaScript. (PR [#6707](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6707))

{/* Would be nice to include an example, but I got a crash trying to make one: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/7192 */}

### `:autofill`

On a more minor note, we implemented the `:autofill` pseudo-class. Ladybird doesn't support automatically filling form data, so this selector never matches, but it does now parse correctly. (PR [#7177](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7177))

### `@import` improvements

The CSS `@import` rule, used to include additional style sheets, has a few ways of controlling when and how the linked style sheet should be applied to the document. This month we implemented the `layer()` clause which places the style sheet inside a CSS layer. We also fixed some bugs that were causing Ladybird to fail to parse `supports()` clauses in `@import` correctly. (PRs [#6986](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6986) and [#7021](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7021))
