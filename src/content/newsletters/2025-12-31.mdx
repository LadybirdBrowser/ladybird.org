December is long gone, and we ended up merging 197 PRs from 37 contributors. Let's check out some of the work that got done!

### Welcoming new sponsors

Ladybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we're excited to welcome the following new sponsors:

- [FUTO](https://www.futo.org/) with $250,000 (renewal!) ([announcement + interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCa92gA1ARc))
- "Open Source Santa" with $5,000 (funds provided by [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), selected by polling the YouTube audience of [ThePrimeagen &amp; teej_dv](https://www.terminal.shop)
- [styfle](https://styfle.dev) with $1,000

### Web Platform Tests (WPT)

Progress on [WPT](https://web-platform-tests.org) continues. This month we've added 4,833 new test passes, bringing our total to 1,977,371.

### The `::part()` pseudo-element

In December we got basic support for the `::part()` pseudo-element, which lets custom elements expose parts of themselves for styling by the outside world. For example `widget::part(quantity)` will target any elements inside `widget`'s shadow-dom that have a `part="quantity"` attribute. (PRs [#7034](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7034) and [#7077](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7077))

There's still work to be done, in particular to support the `exportparts` attribute, but this already improves the appearance of some websites, for example the login button on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org):

### The `random()` CSS function

Another new addition this month is the CSS `random()` function. As its name suggests, this enables authors to use random values in CSS properties, without having to resort to JavaScript. (PR [#6707](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6707))

{/* Would be nice to include an example, but I got a crash trying to make one: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/7192 */}

### `:autofill`

On a more minor note, we implemented the `:autofill` pseudo-class. Ladybird doesn't support automatically filling form data, so this selector never matches, but it does now parse correctly. (PR [#7177](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7177))

### `@import` improvements

The CSS `@import` rule, used to include additional style sheets, has a few ways of controlling when and how the linked style sheet should be applied to the document. This month we implemented the `layer()` clause which places the style sheet inside a CSS layer. We also fixed some bugs that were causing Ladybird to fail to parse `supports()` clauses in `@import` correctly. (PRs [#6986](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6986) and [#7021](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7021))

### Unbuffered media fetching

Building on top of the move to using unbuffered fetch everywhere, our media playback pipeline is now able to play incompletely-buffered files, and wait for data over the network when it is not available yet. (PRs [#7049](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7049), [#7081](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7081), [#7084](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7084) and [#7132](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7132))

### Support for media with no duration

We can now fully play files with unspecified durations, or with a specified duration that is shorter than the actual media data's duration. In order to do so, as data is decoded, we extend the duration of the timeline according to the latest frame's end timestamp. (PR [#6945](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6945))

### Support for audio tracks with differing sample rates or channels

Previously, we would increase the sample rate and channel count of our audio output stream to match the highest values found within a media file. However, since no audio conversion had been implemented, this meant that, for example, enabling a track with stereo audio would cause a mono track to become permanently inaudible.

Now, we always output to the default output device's sample rate and channel map (including the channel count, which we refer to collectively as sample specification), converting to that format as we decode audio data. Thus, all audio timing can remain aligned between all tracks, and will be mixed regardless of whether there are mismatched sample specifications between tracks. (PR [#7095](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7095))

This functionality also allowed WAV playback to be implemented again in the new system with minimal effort, as WAV required passing through a sample specification from the container format to FFmpeg's PCM decoder. (PR [#7149](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7149))

Below is a demo of a file with both mismatched sample specifications, and a smaller duration than the duration of the contained tracks' media data:

### JavaScript performance work

- We've made efforts to shrink the generated code size of the JavaScript interpreter. This benefits Apple Silicon CPUs in particular, and hurts no one. (PRs [#7080](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7080), [#7087](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7087))

- `arguments` objects no longer deoptimize property access in functions that have no named parameters. (PR [#7094](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7094))

- C++ code is now able to use inline caches when setting object properties. (We only had inline caches for getting properties in C++ until now.) (PR [#7111](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7111))

- We've done a number of smaller things to improve regular expression performance. (PRs [#7111](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7111), [#7125](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7125))

- The `x | 0` pattern that's often used to coerce a value into a 32-bit integer now has a dedicated bytecode instruction. (PR [#7140](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7140))

- The `prototype` field on function objects is now lazily instantiated, since most code never uses it. (PR [#7167](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7167))

- We got rid of some code that made a redundant copy of all JavaScript source code(!) (PR [#7209](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7209))

### HTTP caching improvements

HTTP disk cache is now enabled by default ([#6991](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6991)), reducing redundant network traffic on repeat visits. We've also implemented support for the `stale-while-revalidate` Cache-Control directive ([#7121](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7121)). When a cached response falls within the stale-while-revalidate window, it serves the stale response immediately while spawning a background request to revalidate with the origin server.

### Garbage collector leak fixes

We spent time this month hunting down GC leaks. At the start, a full `test-web` run ended with ~240 leaked Window objects. Through a series of fixes, we brought that number down to ~25.

The main problem was improper use of `GC::Root` by storing strong references in places where they keep objects alive forever. This happened in various places: 2D canvas fill/stroke styles, the rejected promises list, custom elements reaction stack, BroadcastChannel, and IndexedDB. In most cases, the fix was switching to `GC::Weak` references. We also introduced `GC::HeapVector`, a vector container that properly participates in GC. (PRs [#7223](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7223), [#7230](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7230), [#7235](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7235), [#7246](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/7246))
