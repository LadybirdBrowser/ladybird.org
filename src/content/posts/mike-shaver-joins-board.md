I'm excited to announce that [Mike Shaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shaver) is joining the board of the Ladybird Browser Initiative. Mike has an incredible history in the browser and tech world. He was one of the founding members of Mozilla, where he held many roles, including VP of Engineering and VP of Technical Strategy.

After Mozilla, he's held key roles at major web companies, including Engineering Director at Facebook and Distinguished Engineer at Shopify. He's now on his way somewhere new, which gave us an opportunity to invite him to our board!

Mike is a hardcore engineering leader with high standards, and we look forward to working with him as we raise the bar for Ladybird. Please join us in welcoming Mike to the board!
