Hello friend! Thank you so much for donating to support Ladybird!

We believe the world needs a truly independent web browser. That's why we are funded entirely by voluntary donations, and we intend to keep it this way forever.

Make sure you sign up for our newsletter below if you'd like to receive monthly updates on our progress!
