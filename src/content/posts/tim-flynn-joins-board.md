We’re pleased to share that [Tim Flynn](https://trflynn89.github.io) is joining the Board of Directors at the Ladybird Browser Initiative. Tim has been a key contributor to the project for over three and a half years, working on Ladybird in his spare time while holding a full-time role at Viasat.

While much of Ladybird’s development is handled by our full-time team, contributions from community members like Tim have been essential to our progress. His work has shaped important parts of the browser, highlighting just how valuable independent contributors are to moving the project forward.

By bringing Tim onto the Board, we’re recognizing the impact of the open-source community and ensuring that independent contributors have a voice in shaping Ladybird’s future. Tim’s insights and experience will be a valuable addition to our leadership team.

We’re excited to continue working with Tim in this new role. Please join us in welcoming him to the Board!
